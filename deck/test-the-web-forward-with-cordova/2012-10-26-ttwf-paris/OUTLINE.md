# Test the Web Forward with Apache Cordova

> Why Apache Cordova can help test the web forward

## This guy

- Michael Brooks

## What is Apache Cordova

### Apache Cordova turns this into a native app

- ---> mobile web site
- ---> <iframe>

### Written in 100% web technology

### Your app is a full screen browser

### Without the UI chrome

### And loads a local index.html

### Extended with native bindings

- W3C specifications and drafts

## PhoneGap

- A distribution of Apache Cordova

## Apache Cordova can help Test the Web Forward

### It can (and does) implement W3C drafts

### This sort of makes it a browser from the future

- quick marty, dial Cordova forward 2 years!

### With Apache Cordova

#### We can implement specs before browser adoption

#### Expose the spec to thousands of developers

#### And collect practical usage feedback about the spec

### This can help the W3C

#### Prototype the spec before finalizing it

### And give browser vendors

#### a test suite of the spec

#### So that tests exist before their implementation

#### Improving the web for everyone

## Thanks
